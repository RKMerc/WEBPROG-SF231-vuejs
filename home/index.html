      Hobbies & Interests: One of my main hobbies is to read and play video games. Reading provides me with much entertainment for times when I am either bored or have completed my tasks. Gaming helps relax my mind as well as de-stress from work or studies and helps provide me with some insight as to how other games implement unique systems and game mechanics into their games. This experience is valuable to me both for social and professional improvements as I aspire to be a game developer as well as allow me to see what is both popular and engaging for different kinds of people with regards to games.
